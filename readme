Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains 10 diverse machine learning projects, each designed to tackle real-world problems using predictive modeling, classification, and regression techniques. The projects cover a variety of domains and showcase a range of machine learning approaches.

Below are the titles and brief descriptions of the projects included in this repository:

Project List
Parkinson's Disease Prediction
A classification model to predict Parkinson's disease based on medical voice measurements.

Students Exam Prediction
Predicting students' exam scores based on study hours and other academic factors.
Titanic Survival Prediction
A classification model to predict passenger survival during the Titanic disaster based on demographics and travel class.

Heart Disease Prediction
A predictive model to identify the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data.

Insurance Cost Prediction
A regression model to predict insurance costs based on demographic and lifestyle factors.

Loan Prediction
A classification model to determine whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data.

Movie Recommendation Prediction
A recommendation system to predict user preferences for movies based on viewing history.

Sonar Object Prediction
A model to classify objects detected by sonar as either rocks or mines.

Spam Mail Prediction
A classification model to detect spam emails based on text features.

Wine Quality Prediction
A regression model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

Repository Structure
Each project is organized in its respective folder and includes:

Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks with the implementation.
Relevant documentation detailing the problem statement, methodology, and results.
Preprocessed datasets or links to the original datasets.
Prerequisites
Before running the projects, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. (Refer to each project's folder for additional dependencies).
